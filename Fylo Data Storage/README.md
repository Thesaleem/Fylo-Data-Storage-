## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make a comment box using the clip path property, how to use vendor prefixes, and pseudo elements and how to use a linear gradient

Some of the codes I used are:

```css
.data::after{ 
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 100%, 100% 0);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm going to explore using more pseudo elements and also get better understanding of using the :root element. I'm also looking to try out animations in CSS.


### Useful resources

- [Clip Path Generator](https://www.cssportal.com/css-clip-path-generator/) - This helped me generate the property value for the polygon shape.
